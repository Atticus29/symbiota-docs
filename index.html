Click Duplicate Cleaning Tools. In the bottom box under Taxonomy, click \u0026ldquo;Duplicate specimens with potential identification conflicts\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nThis tool lists the duplicate clusters of specimens (specimens that have the same collector, number, and date, even across different collections) for which one or more of the specimens does not have the same taxonomic name. The tool can be used to identify whether there are specimens in your collection that should be annotated to the most recently identified taxonomic name. For example, in the cluster below, OBI and UCR may consider annotating their specimens according to the most recent identification of the SBBG duplicate. The specimen records associated with each specimen can be viewed by clicking on the catalog number of the desired record.\n</p><p>data cleaning</p><p>taxonomy</p><p>duplicates</p>",url:"https:\/\/biokic.github.io\/symbiota-docs\/coll_manager\/data_cleaning\/id_conflict\/"},{value:"User Guide",label:"<p></p>",url:"https:\/\/biokic.github.io\/symbiota-docs\/user\/"},{value:"Batch Uploading\/Linking Images",label:"<p> This page describes how to upload multiple images at a time or link multiple images from an external location.\n There are several workflows used to batch upload\/link specimen images. Batch processing typically consists of two separate steps: 1) Batch loading images onto a web server, and 2) Mapping image URLs to specimen records residing within the Symbiota portal. Technically, images are not stored within a Symbiota database. Instead, the URLs of the images are mapped to specimen records. Contact the portal manager to inquire about the workflow details supported by a given portal.\nImages uploaded or linked to specimens in a Symbiota portal should be JPGs or in another web-friendly format. It is recommended that individual files are no larger than 8 MB to allow users with slower connectivity to view them within a reasonable timeframe.\n Common Workflows   Image Drop Folder: Using a mapped network drive, FTP, SFTP, Dropbox, or other cloud storage, a drop folder is made available so that imaging team can regularly deposit new images. This folder is referred to as the \u0026ldquo;source folder\u0026rdquo;. Once images are uploaded to the source folder, you can use the Processing Toolbox to create web-ready derivatives and move the images to a local server. The derivatives are then mapped to specimen records through image URLs.\n  Local Storage: If images are stored on a local server that is write-accessible to the portal code, image processing can be performed directly through the portal interface. Image URLs stored locally can be mapped into the database using relative links without the domain name. In this case, the the web server user (e.g. Apache user) must have write access to both the source and target folders.\n  Remote Image Storage: Images can also be processed and stored on a remote server and mapped to the specimen image through the full image URL. Standalone image processing scripts will be needed to process images and map image URLs to the portal database. Scripts can be configured to write the image URL directly to the database or image metadata can be written to a log file, which is loaded into the database afterwards. Remote images must be mapped into the database using the full image URL with the domain name.\n If only a large image is made available from the remote server, the image URL can be mapped to the urloriginal field, and then portal will then create local web and thumbnail dirivatives. If the images are named using the catalog number, and the web server is configured to display directory contents, the Processing Toolbox within the collection\u0026rsquo;s management menu contains a method to harvest image links from the directory listing. Alternatively, one can perform a \u0026ldquo;skeletal record import\u0026rdquo; that contains a column with the catalogNumber and another associatedMedia column with the image URL.    CyVerse Image Storage: This method requires an agreement of a collection with CyVerse. CyVerse can store images as Community Data files and use BisQue to create web-accessible URLs for these files. You can then use the Processing Toolbox to map CyVerse URLs to specimen records in your portal.\n  </p><p>images</p>",url:"https:\/\/biokic.github.io\/symbiota-docs\/coll_manager\/images\/batch\/"},{value:"Duplicate Catalog Numbers",label:"<p> This page describes how to identify and merge (when necessary) specimens with duplicate catalog nubmers or other catalog numbers.\n This tool can be found in the Administration Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection).\nTo use the tool, first select whether you would like to list duplicates based on Catalog Numbers or Other Catalog Numbers from the “List Duplicates based on\u0026hellip;” box. If duplicates exist, a table of duplicate records will appear on the resulting page.\nFrom here, you can evaluate whether the duplicate records should be edited, merged, or ignored. To view and\/or edit a record, click the number in the ID column next to the record you wish to view. This will open that specimen’s Record Editor page.\nIf you decide that the two records should be merged, check the boxes next to both duplicates, then select the radio button that corresponds to the record you wish to make the primary record. If both records have a value in a given field, Symbiota will keep the value that belongs to this primary record and discard the other value. When you are satisfied that the correct information will be retained, click the Merge Duplicate Records button.\nIf there are many duplicate records to evaluate, you can click the checkbox at the top of the checkbox column. This will check all of the boxes in the entire table. You can also select the radio button column header, which will allow Symbiota to auto-select a record to retain for each pair. You will want to vet this list to ensure that the correct record is selected for retention.\n </p><p>data cleaning</p><p>duplicates</p>",url:"https:\/\/biokic.github.io\/symbiota-docs\/coll_manager\/data_cleaning\/dupes\/"},{value:"Linking New Images to Old Records",label:"<p> This page addresses a common digitization workflow challenge: how do you link images of specimens (with new barcode numbers) to specimen records that already exist in the portal if the barcode number isn\u0026rsquo;t associated with the old data yet? Here we describe two options to solve this problem.\n The following instructions assume that the barcode number is stored in the Catalog Number field, and the accession number (usually a stamped number) is stored in the Other Catalog Numbers field.\n Option 1: Add catalog (barcode) numbers to occurrence records while imaging This protocol describes how to add a barcode number to each of the specimens that you image during the imaging process.\n (Example instructions for an herbarium collection)\n Acquire a specimen. Log in to your account and navigate to your Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection). Click Edit Existing Occurrence Records. Place a barcode on your specimen. Look for a stamped number (“accession number”) on the specimen.  If a stamped number does not exist, proceed to step 8.   In the Record Search Form, enter the stamped number into the Other Catalog Numbers field. Do not include leading zeros (e.g., if the stamp is 01499, enter 1499). Click Display Editor.  If no record is returned, double check that you entered the accession number correctly into the Other Catalog Numbers field and that there are no extra spaces before or after the numbers you typed. If the number is correct, contact a supervisor. If a record is returned, check that the data on the specimen record match the data on the label of the specimen in front of you, particularly collector, collector number, and date. i. If these data match, place your cursor in the Catalog Number field (top left) and scan the barcode of the specimen in front of you. The barcode number will then appear in this field. Press Tab on your keyboard, followed by Enter. Proceed with imaging the specimen and return to step 1. ii. If these data do NOT match, contact a supervisor.    To re-open the Record Search Form after you have performed a search, click the magnifying glass icon at the top right side of the specimen record.\n In the Record Search Form, enter the last name of the collector preceded by a percent sign (%), the collector number, and the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) into the top three fields (see example below) and click Display Editor.  If no record is returned, double check that you entered data correctly into the appropriate fields. If everything looks correct, contact a supervisor. If a record is returned, check that the data on the specimen record match the data on the label of the specimen in front of you, particularly collector, collector number, and date. i.\tIf these data match, place your cursor in the Catalog Number field (top right) and scan the barcode of the specimen in front of you. The barcode number will then appear in this field. Press Tab on your keyboard, followed by Enter. Proceed with imaging the specimen and return to step 1. ii.\tIf these data do NOT match, contact a supervisor.    Option 2: View new images in the portal and link by manually entering the accession number This protocol describes how to update your old accession number with the specimen’s new barcode number. You can do this only after you have uploaded specimen images into your portal through a batch process that has created new \u0026ldquo;unprocessed\u0026rdquo; records consisting of only a barcode number and an image.\n (Example instructions for an herbarium collection)\n Log in to your account and navigate to your Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection). Click Edit Existing Occurrence Records. In the Record Search Form, click the Processing Status field and select “Unprocessed” from the dropdown menu. In the Custom Field 1 field, select Other Catalog Number from the first dropdown menu and IS NULL from the second dropdown menu. Click the “Display Editor” button. Locate the accession number (the stamped number, rather than the barcoded number or the collector number) on the specimen in the image to the right of the Occurrence Editor form.  You can zoom in by pressing Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) and clicking on the image where you want to zoom in. Alternatively, you can hold Shift, click on the area where you want to zoom in, and move the mouse up (to zoom in) or down (to zoom out).   Enter the accession number, without leading zeros (e.g., if the number reads “0145”, you will enter “145”), into the Other Cat. #s field (circled in screenshot below).  Click outside of the Other Cat. #s field (or press the Tab button). A message should show up under the “Dupes?” button. Make sure that your browser’s pop-up blocker is disabled so you can see these messages.  If the message shows “No Dupes Found”:  Check that the specimen sheet is not stamped “Databased” or has any other indication that it SHOULD have a record in the database. If it is, try adding a leading zero to the accession number and repeat step 9. Press the Save Edits button (or press Tab and Enter on your keyboard) Move on to step 9.   If a pop-up window shows up that says “Record(s) using the same identifier already exists. Do you want to view this record?”:  Click OK. Check that the identified duplicate does not already have an image associated with it (if it does, you will see a bold barcode number on that record). If the duplicate does have an image already, close the window, scroll down to the Processing status field in the Curation box, select “Expert Required” from the dropdown menu, and then click the Save Edits button. Otherwise, move to step c. Check that the data of the identified duplicate matches the data on the label of the specimen image you were viewing. You need not check every field, just two or three important fields such as Scientific Name, Collector, and Locality. If the data match up, click “Merge Records” and exit the duplicate window. If the data do not match up, close the window, scroll down to the Processing status field in the Curation box, select “Expert Required” from the dropdown menu, and then click the Save Edits button.     Click the double arrow icon at the top right corner of the occurrence editor.

For more information about the taxonomic thesaurus, visit the Taxonomy page.\n The taxonomic cleaning tools are great resources for cleaning up misspellings and other taxonomic name entries that do not link to names in the central taxonomic thesaurus. They are meant to aid in locating and fixing taxonomic errors and inconsistencies.\nAnalyze Taxonomic Names   This function analyzes the values that exist in the Scientific Name field in your database and flags the values that are not linked to the taxonomic thesaurus (i.e., are not linked to a recognized name). Note that this tool does NOT evaluate whether that name is accepted according to current taxonomy. The number of unrecognized scientific names is listed at the top of the Action Menu box.\nYou can evaluate the unrecognized scientific names and link them to the names of the correct taxa by clicking the name of the Taxonomic Resource to which you want to compare the names, selecting the target kingdom, and clicking the Analyze Taxonomic Names button. If you wish to begin at a certain name (e.g., you have already checked names up to Mentzelia), you can enter this name in the Start Index field. You can also alter the number of names you would like the portal to analyze per run in the Names Processed per Run field. There are multiple types of results from running this tool. In general, the tool will list the name that it is attempting to index (i.e., match to an existing taxonomic name), search your defined taxonomic resource for that name, and, if that name is not found in the taxonomic resource, check the taxonomic thesaurus for similar names to the unrecognized name. You then have several options for resolving the unrecognized name, depending on the type of result. To view the specimen(s) associated with any unrecognized name, click the pencil icon to the right of the name and number of specimens, in brackets. The types of results are explained in more detail below.\nExample 1: Misspelling, incomplete name, or orthographic variant This is the most common type of result. In this case, you discover that the unrecognized name was misspelled or spelled differently than the recognized name. You can click “remap to this taxon” to change the name of the specimen(s) to this recognized name.\nExample 2: Unpublished or unrecognized taxon name In this case, you find that the name listed on the specimen was not published or is not currently listed in the taxonomic thesaurus. You must then use taxonomic expertise to decide whether this specimen should be remapped to a different taxonomic name (if you are confident that they are synonymous) and\/or annotated, or if the taxonomic name should be left as is and it should be included in the taxonomic thesaurus. If you believe that a name should be found in the taxonomic thesaurus and you do not find it with a manual search, contact the portal manager.\nExample 3: Name exists but is not found in taxonomic thesaurus When the portal does not find a name in the taxonomic thesaurus, but it does find the name in the taxonomic resource, it will import the taxonomic name into the taxonomic thesaurus. This will automatically map the specimen’s taxonomic name to this newly added entry in the taxonomic thesaurus as well.\nIf you have not analyzed all the taxonomic names in one pass, you can click the Continue Analyzing Names button to have Symbiota check the next 20 (or whatever number is defined by the user) names.\nTaxonomic Distributions Much like the Geographic Distribution viewer, the Taxonomic Distribution viewer can be used to examine the families, genera, species, and infraspecific taxa that exist in your database. Misspellings, non-standardized entries, or suspected mistakes can be detected using this tool. To view the genera for each family, click the name of the family. Then, to view the species for each genus, click the name of the genus, and so on.

You may want to start by adding them individually so you can become familiar with the information that can be uploaded and the care one needs to take in doing so.\nAdding Individual Taxa    On the checklist page, click the rightmost pencil icon (labeled spp.) at the top right of the page. This will bring up a panel on the lower right side of the screen. Add the name of a taxon you wish to add. Do NOT include the authorship of the taxon. You can start typing, and a dropdown list will allow you to select the taxon from available options.  You cannot add a name that is not present in the taxonomic thesaurus (it will tell you if this is the case). If you find that the taxon you wish to add is not present:  Check that your spelling is correct. Use a vetted taxonomic resources, such as Tropicos or IPNI to check. If your spelling is correct, contact your portal manager with the name, authorship, and a reference or link to that name in another taxonomic database, and it will be added for you.     Fill in the other fields if desired. All of these fields can be left blank:  Family Override: If you enter the family name here, you will override the family provided by the taxonomic thesaurus. It is advised not to enter anything in this field. Habitat: If the taxon is usually found in a particular habitat in the area circumscribed by the checklist, you can include this information here. Abundance: Here you can note how frequently\/abundantly this taxon is found in the area circumscribed by the checklist. For example, you can use terms like “common,” “frequent,” or “rare.” Notes: Any other comments about this taxon pertaining to your checklist area can be put here, for example: “Cultivated ornamental” or “favored by honeybees” Internal notes: This field, unlike the others, will be visible only to people authorized to edit the checklist. You might make a note “need to check the species” or “no picture available” for example. Source: This field is more likely to be used for research and teaching checklists. For such checklists, it is useful to know whether the information came from a flora, some other publication, or a report by some   Click the “Add species to List” button.  Batch Adding Taxa   If you have several taxa to add at one time, you can upload them in a CSV (comma separated value) file. The easiest way to create the desired listing is to use Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc and then save the file as a CSV file. In your CSV file, one column in the file should be labeled sciname. This should contain the scientific name of the taxon WITHOUT the authorship included. In this CSV file, you must be very careful to spell the scientific names correctly. If you have an error in your spelling, you will not be able to load that name into your checklist. You can also include “family”, “habitat”, “abundance”, and “notes” columns (see above for descriptions of these fields) in this file. An example is shown below.\n   Sciname Habitat Abundance Notes     Asystasia gangetica Middle of the field Rare Demonstration; correct spelling   Asystasia gangetca field unknown Demonstration; wrong spelling    Below is a screenshot of uploading the previous example “file”.

You can add specific, individual specimens from your own collection to the checklist through the occurrence editor (the page of the specimen record) or add specimens from any collection through the Manage Linked Voucher tool on the checklist page.\nAdding Individual Specimens from Your Own Collection  Look up a specific specimen in your own collection (e.g., by clicking Edit Existing Occurrence Records in your Data Editor Control Panel and searching by a specific catalog number or by using other search terms). On the resulting page, click the Linked Resources tab. In the Checklist Voucher Linkages box (see below), select the desired Checklist from the dropdown menu and click Link to Checklist as Voucher. A new window will likely pop up as a result, but you can ignore this window and close the editor. The specimen has been successfully linked as a voucher to the desired checklist.  Adding Specimens from Any Collection (Manage Linked Voucher Tool)    Navigate to the homepage of your checklist. Click the pencil icon that has a V next to it (the center icon in the top right corner of the page, circled below).  If this is the first time you have used this tool, you will be asked to first define the search statement (i.e., search parameters) that will be used to find the specimens that might pertain to your checklist. You can use a variety of fields to define your search, as described below.  You will be able to change the search statement in the future, so you are not necessarily defining the bounds forever.\n  You can enter search terms for a number of fields on the left side of the form. You can use the polygon footprint that you defined when creating the checklist (see 29:1 Creating a checklist, step 3c) to search for specimen records by checking the “Search based on polygon defining checklist research boundaries” box. If you did not define a polygon previously, you can also do so from here by clicking the pencil icon to the right of this option and following the steps outlined in 29:1 Creating a checklist, step 3c. You can define a specific bounding box by entering the latitude and longitude values that delimit the box, or by defining the lat\/long values on a map. To do the latter:  Click the globe icon to the right of the Lat North field In the pop-up window, pan and zoom to the location where you want to place the bounding box. Click on the approximate center where you want the bounding box to be located. Adjust the location and size of the bounding box as desired by clicking and dragging inside the box (to move the box) or clicking and dragging one of the circles on the sides or corners of the box (to resize the box). To save the bounding box, click Save and Close.     There are a number of important checkboxes below the Lat\/Long fields that you can use to refine your search. For example, you can allow the search to return specimens with the desired search terms OR within certain latitude and longitude coordinates. You can use any combination of the above options to search for voucher specimens.  Once you have entered the desired search terms, click the Save Search Terms button. There are a number of ways to add voucher specimens from this point.   If you have already defined a taxon list for your checklist, you can add voucher specimens from the New Vouchers tab. From this tab, you can:  View taxa that do not currently have voucher specimens in your checklist (select Non-vouchered taxa list from the Display Mode dropdown list). View specimen records that match your search criteria and are one of the taxa defined in your taxon list that is NOT currently vouchered (select Occurrences for non-vouchered taxa from the Display Mode dropdown list).  To add voucher specimens from this list, click the box to the left of the specimen record(s) that you wish to add and click the Add Vouchers button.   View specimen records that match your search criteria and are one of the taxa defined in your taxon list, regardless of whether that taxon has been vouchered previously (select New occurrences for all taxa from the Display Mode dropdown list).   To add voucher specimens from this list, click the box to the left of the specimen record(s) that you wish to add and click the Add Vouchers button. Regardless of whether you have previously defined a taxon list for your checklist, you can add voucher specimens through the Missing Taxa tab. From this tab, you can:  View the taxa that are not found in the checklist currently but are represented by one or more specimens that align with your search criteria (select Species List from the Display Mode dropdown list).  You can then view a list of the specimens associated with each taxon by clicking the page and link icon . From there, you can link the desired specimens individually by clicking the add voucher icon to the right of the specimen record in the list.   View the specimens that are not yet added as voucher specimens for your checklist but do align with your search criteria (select Batch Linking from the Display Mode dropdown menu).  To add voucher specimens from this list, click the box to the left of the specimen record(s) that you wish to add and click the Add Vouchers button.   View specimen records that align with your search criteria, but have scientific names that are not linked to a particular name in the taxonomic thesaurus (select Problem Taxa from the Display Mode dropdown menu).  To add voucher specimens from this list, enter the name of the taxon to which this specimen belongs into the text box to the right of the specimen’s scientific name.

Collections that make use of an in-house management system (e.g. Specify, Ke-Emu, etc.) and only publish a snapshot of their data to a Symbiota instance can also use the portal to publish their data to GBIF, but only if: 1) they are not publishing their data through another means (e.g. IPT installation, VertNet, etc.), and 2) an occurrenceID GUID is included in the data being pushed from their in-house database to the Symbiota dataset. If the collection is using the Symbiota publishing tool built into Specify, the occurrenceID GUID will be automatically included in the data upload from Specify.\nYour portal must be set up as a GBIF Publishing Installation to publishing your data to GBIF. This can be done by your portal manager.\n  Set up an institutional account with GBIF so that there is a direct publishing agreement established between GBIF and the institution. Since the institutional account will be used to list multiple collection datasets associated with that institution (https:\/\/www.gbif.org\/publisher\/4c0e9f60-c489-11d8-bf60-b8a03c50a862), you should coordinate with other collections within your institution, if applicable. Note that the institutional datasets can be published to GBIF using different publishing resources. For instance, the zoological collections could import their data from VertNet IPT (http:\/\/ipt.vertnet.org) or their institutional IPT, vascular plant data from the SEINet https:\/\/swbiodiversity.org, and lichens from CNALH (https:\/\/lichenportal.org). Use the GBIF Endorsement Request page (https:\/\/www.gbif.org\/become-a-publisher) to register your institution. Use the organization lookup on that page to make sure your institution is not already registered.  If you are sure your institution is not yet registered, complete the registration form and follow the instructions provided by GBIF. If your institution is already registered, review the GBIF metadata for your organization and existing datasets and contact GBIF to make any necessary changes. Be sure that none of the existing datasets contain the same data you are trying to publish. If they do, make the appropriate arrangements with GBIF so that the old dataset can be archived BEFORE re-publishing the new dataset.   Login to your Symbiota portal, go to your Administrator Control Panel (via My Profile =\u0026gt; Specimen Management tab =\u0026gt; click your collection name), and click on \u0026ldquo;Edit Metadata and Contact Information\u0026rdquo; link in the Administration Control Panel. Verify your collection name and description (these will be used within the GBIF page), check the GBIF box to the right of \u0026ldquo;Publish to Aggregators\u0026rdquo;, and click the \u0026ldquo;Save Edits\u0026rdquo; button. If you do not see a GBIF publishing checkbox, contact your portal manager and ask them to configure the portal for GBIF publishing. Return to the Administrator Contol Panel and click on the \u0026ldquo;Darwin Core Archive Publishing\u0026rdquo; link in the Administration Control Panel. Click \u0026ldquo;Create\/Refresh Darwin Core Archive\u0026rdquo; button to package up your data within a Darwin Core Archive data package. Enter your institution\u0026rsquo;s GBIF publication key and click the Validate Key button. If you key validates, more instructions will be displayed along with a Submit Data button. The GBIF Publisher Key should have the following format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (e.g. 4c0e9f60-c489-11d8-bf60-b8a03c50a872). You can also enter the full URL to your GBIF publishing page, and the key will be automatically extracted. Before you can submit data, you will need to contact GBIF help desk (helpdesk@gbif.org) and request for the portal\u0026rsquo;s GBIF user account to be given permission to create and update datasets within your institution\u0026rsquo;s publishing instance. The GBIF username associated with the Symbiota portal installation is displayed in paragraph above the Submit Data button. Click on the GBIF email address to automatically generate a message within your email client. Once you hear back from GBIF affirming that the portal has permission to submit data to your publisher, click the Submit Data button. A link to your GBIF dataset will be immediately displayed, though it may take an hour or so for your data to be loaded, indexed, and available.  </p><p>aggregator</p><p>gbif</p><p>data publishing</p>",url:"https:\/\/biokic.github.io\/symbiota-docs\/coll_manager\/data_publishing\/gbif\/"},{value:"About",label:"<p>Symbiota Docs is a central repository for documentation regarding Symbiota-based data portals.
