These images can be viewed through Taxon Profile Pages, which have general information such as descriptions, distribution maps, synonyms, and common names. Field images are uploaded and managed through the Taxon Profile pages by users with Taxon Profile editing permissions. Field images with specific locality details (e.g. coordinates) can be loaded as Image Vouchers (see \u0022Field Images with Location\u0022 tab). See Uploading Images for more details.  Field images with specific locality information can adequately serve as vouchers for field observations of many birds, mammals, and easy-to-identify plants. In some instances, they may actually be preferable, for instance if the organism is rare or the observer does not have the appropriate collecting permit. These images are similar to georeferenced specimen records in that they are searchable occurrence records that place a dot on the species distribution maps. There are, however, some taxonomic groups that typically require microscopic or chemical analysis for accurate identification (e.g. lichens, bryophytes, fungi). For such organisms, field images will have limited value. For this reason, some data portals might not allow the submission of observations without a physical specimen. Image Vouchers are displayed on both the Occurrence Details and the Taxon Profile pages. Image-supported observations can be uploaded using the Observation Submission page. Up to three images can be submitted for a single observation. Data fields required for an image to qualify as a voucher include: observer name, observation date, country, state, locality description, latitude, longitude, and at least one image. Contact your data portal administrator for information on whether observations are allowed and the necessary protocols for submitting an observation. Some portals require the review of a tutorial before one is authorized to submit an observation. See Uploading Images for more details.  Images of physical specimens should be linked to their respective specimen records. Specimen images are available both from the Occurrence Details page and the Taxon Profile page for the taxon associated with the most recent determination. If the specimen identification is annotated, the identification of the image will be automatically re-mapped to that taxon. Specimen images can be added through the Occurrence Editor or in batch via multiple processes.

It is also possible to link images that are stored in external servers. For information about the latter option, visit the Batch Adding\/Linking Images page.\n Specimen images Contribute to this section!\nNote that if the image is given a sort order value of greater than 500, that image will be displayed on the Occurrence Details page but not on the Species Profile display. This is typically done for images of poor quality or due to aesthetic issues (e.g. road kills). Specimen images can be added via the user interface by clicking on the Image tab within the Occurrence Editor. See below for screen captures of the Occurrence Editor interface. See the Image Batch Loading page for workflows being used to load images in mass. A field image can be linked to a specimen record, but the image must be of the specific individual that was collected. Field images of a vouchered specimen are considered high valued images since species identifications can be verified or annotated years afterwards by close inspection of the physical specimen.\nThere are three catefories of images that can be linked to a Symbiota portal. Instructions for uploading each of these types are provided below.\nField image without location information Images without specific locality information (e.g. lat\/long coordinates) are linked only to the scientific name of the organism. These images can be viewed on the Taxon Profile Page, which has general information such as descriptions, distribution maps, synonyms, and common names. To upload an image:\n Log in to your account in the portal. You must have Taxon Profile Editor permissions to do the following\n  Navigate to the page of the taxon you wish to edit. To do so, you may be able to:  Click Sitemap, then Taxonomic Tree Viewer or Taxonomy Explorer. Search for the taxon of interest and click its name. Perform a quick search on the home page for the taxon of interest.   Click the pencil icon at the top right corner of the taxon page. Click the Add Image tab. Select the image file you would like to upload from Choose File, then enter any additional information in the provided fields.  The Sort Sequence field allows you to determine the order of the images that will show up on the taxon profile. The higher the number, the further down the priority list the image will be.   Click the Upload Image button. Field images are uploaded and managed through the Taxon Profile Editing interface. Users with Taxon Profile editing permissions can submit an image by clicking on the editing symbol located in the upper right of any Taxon Profile page, or through the image submission links available on the sitemap page. Field images with specific locality details (e.g. coordinates) can be loaded as Image Vouchers (see below).

A DwC-A includes metadata, a file of occurrence data, and, often, files for determinations (identifications), images, and any other data extensions.\nYou can only publish a Darwin Core Archive of occurrences that have unique occurrence IDs and GUIDs. In your collection metadata page, make sure that you have selected a source for your GUID and that this source contains unique values for each occurrence.\n  Navigate to your Administration Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of your collection).

Collections that make use of an in-house management system (e.g. Specify, Ke-Emu, etc.) and only publish a snapshot of their data to a Symbiota instance can also use the portal to publish their data to GBIF, but only if: 1) they are not publishing their data through another means (e.g. IPT installation, VertNet, etc.), and 2) an occurrenceID GUID is included in the data being pushed from their in-house database to the Symbiota dataset. If the collection is using the Symbiota publishing tool built into Specify, the occurrenceID GUID will be automatically included in the data upload from Specify.\nYour portal must be set up as a GBIF Publishing Installation to publishing your data to GBIF. This can be done by your portal manager.\n  Set up an institutional account with GBIF so that there is a direct publishing agreement established between GBIF and the institution. Since the institutional account will be used to list multiple collection datasets associated with that institution (https:\/\/www.gbif.org\/publisher\/4c0e9f60-c489-11d8-bf60-b8a03c50a862), you should coordinate with other collections within your institution, if applicable. Note that the institutional datasets can be published to GBIF using different publishing resources. For instance, the zoological collections could import their data from VertNet IPT (http:\/\/ipt.vertnet.org) or their institutional IPT, vascular plant data from the SEINet https:\/\/swbiodiversity.org, and lichens from CNALH (https:\/\/lichenportal.org). Use the GBIF Endorsement Request page (https:\/\/www.gbif.org\/become-a-publisher) to register your institution. Use the organization lookup on that page to make sure your institution is not already registered.  If you are sure your institution is not yet registered, complete the registration form and follow the instructions provided by GBIF. If your institution is already registered, review the GBIF metadata for your organization and existing datasets and contact GBIF to make any necessary changes. Be sure that none of the existing datasets contain the same data you are trying to publish. If they do, make the appropriate arrangements with GBIF so that the old dataset can be archived BEFORE re-publishing the new dataset.   Login to your Symbiota portal, go to your Administrator Control Panel (via My Profile =\u0026gt; Specimen Management tab =\u0026gt; click your collection name), and click on \u0026ldquo;Edit Metadata and Contact Information\u0026rdquo; link in the Administration Control Panel. Verify your collection name and description (these will be used within the GBIF page), check the GBIF box to the right of \u0026ldquo;Publish to Aggregators\u0026rdquo;, and click the \u0026ldquo;Save Edits\u0026rdquo; button. If you do not see a GBIF publishing checkbox, contact your portal manager and ask them to configure the portal for GBIF publishing. Return to the Administrator Contol Panel and click on the \u0026ldquo;Darwin Core Archive Publishing\u0026rdquo; link in the Administration Control Panel. Click \u0026ldquo;Create\/Refresh Darwin Core Archive\u0026rdquo; button to package up your data within a Darwin Core Archive data package. Enter your institution\u0026rsquo;s GBIF publication key and click the Validate Key button. If you key validates, more instructions will be displayed along with a Submit Data button. The GBIF Publisher Key should have the following format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (e.g. 4c0e9f60-c489-11d8-bf60-b8a03c50a872). You can also enter the full URL to your GBIF publishing page, and the key will be automatically extracted. Before you can submit data, you will need to contact GBIF help desk (helpdesk@gbif.org) and request for the portal\u0026rsquo;s GBIF user account to be given permission to create and update datasets within your institution\u0026rsquo;s publishing instance. The GBIF username associated with the Symbiota portal installation is displayed in paragraph above the Submit Data button. Click on the GBIF email address to automatically generate a message within your email client. Once you hear back from GBIF affirming that the portal has permission to submit data to your publisher, click the Submit Data button. A link to your GBIF dataset will be immediately displayed, though it may take an hour or so for your data to be loaded, indexed, and available.  </p><p>aggregator</p><p>gbif</p><p>data publishing</p>",url:"https:\/\/biokic.github.io\/symbiota-docs\/user\/data_publishing\/gbif_publishing\/"},{value:"Symbiota Docs",label:"<p></p>",url:"https:\/\/biokic.github.io\/symbiota-docs\/"},{value:"Batch Uploading\/Linking Images",label:"<p> This page describes how to upload multiple images at a time or link multiple images from an external location.\n There are several workflows used to batch upload\/link specimen images. Batch processing typically consists of two separate steps: 1) Batch loading images onto a web server, and 2) Mapping image URLs to specimen records residing within the Symbiota portal. Technically, images are not stored within a Symbiota database. Instead, the URLs of the images are mapped to specimen records. Contact the portal manager to inquire about the workflow details supported by a given portal.\nImages uploaded or linked to specimens in a Symbiota portal should be JPGs or in another web-friendly format. It is recommended that individual files are no larger than 8 MB to allow users with slower connectivity to view them within a reasonable timeframe.\n Common Workflows   Image Drop Folder: Using a mapped network drive, FTP, SFTP, Dropbox, or other cloud storage, a drop folder is made available so that imaging team can regularly deposit new images. This folder is referred to as the \u0026ldquo;source folder\u0026rdquo;. Once images are uploaded to the source folder, you can use the Processing Toolbox to create web-ready derivatives and move the images to a local server. The derivatives are then mapped to specimen records through image URLs.\n  Local Storage: If images are stored on a local server that is write-accessible to the portal code, image processing can be performed directly through the portal interface. Image URLs stored locally can be mapped into the database using relative links without the domain name. In this case, the the web server user (e.g. Apache user) must have write access to both the source and target folders.\n  Remote Image Storage: Images can also be processed and stored on a remote server and mapped to the specimen image through the full image URL. Standalone image processing scripts will be needed to process images and map image URLs to the portal database. Scripts can be configured to write the image URL directly to the database or image metadata can be written to a log file, which is loaded into the database afterwards. Remote images must be mapped into the database using the full image URL with the domain name.\n If only a large image is made available from the remote server, the image URL can be mapped to the urloriginal field, and then portal will then create local web and thumbnail dirivatives. If the images are named using the catalog number, and the web server is configured to display directory contents, the Processing Toolbox within the collection\u0026rsquo;s management menu contains a method to harvest image links from the directory listing. Alternatively, one can perform a \u0026ldquo;skeletal record import\u0026rdquo; that contains a column with the catalogNumber and another associatedMedia column with the image URL.    CyVerse Image Storage: This method requires an agreement of a collection with CyVerse. CyVerse can store images as Community Data files and use BisQue to create web-accessible URLs for these files. You can then use the Processing Toolbox to map CyVerse URLs to specimen records in your portal.\n  </p><p>images</p>",url:"https:\/\/biokic.github.io\/symbiota-docs\/user\/images\/batch_images\/"},{value:"User Guide",label:"<p>Welcome to the documentation pages of Symbiota Docs!

Include a link to your collection profile page (e.g. http:\/\/swbiodiversity.org\/seinet\/collections\/misc\/collprofiles.php?collid=1) so that they have the necessary information for your collection and access to your data. For more information, see the iDigBio Data Ingestion Guide. Log in to your Administrator Control Panel in your Symbiota portal (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of your collection). Click Edit Metadata and review the information and contacts associated with your collection. In addition to your institution\/collection codes and contact information, make sure to review data usage license and GUID (see below). Contact your portal manager if you are unclear about any of the available fields.   Data Usage License: This field determines the copyright guidelines that users must follow when using your data. Many portals have predefined options that follow the Creative Commons licenses, though that can vary by portal instance. See the Creative Commons website for more information about licenses. GUID source: This designates the field that will serve as the persistent globally unique identifier (GUID) for specimen records published from the portal. (More information about the importance of GUIDs can be found in this article. You will see the following options in your portal:  Occurrence ID: This option is for collections that create their own GUID using another protocol or manage their data in an external system and map the incoming GUID to the occurrenceID field at time of import. If you manage your central data within an update-to-date Specify database, you should use this option because the import data should automatically contain a Specify-generated UUID. Darwin Core definition: http:\/\/rs.tdwg.org\/dwc\/terms\/index.htm#occurrenceID. Catalog Number: You can use this option if your catalog number is configured as a globally unique identifier. See the Darwin Core occurrenceID definition above. Symbiota-generated UUID: If you are managing your data live within the Symbiota instance (e.g. the portal is your central database), this option is the easiest and most reliable method for assigning robust GUIDs to your specimen records. Even if your catalog number is configured as a unique identifier (e.g. institutionCode:collectionCode:catalogNumber format type), this is a more robust option when managing data within the portal. Do not select this option if you use the Symbiota portal to publish a snapshot of your data that is managed in another database system (e.g. Specify).    Return to your Administrator Control Panel and click “Darwin Core Archive Publishing”. Click the Create Darwin Core Archive button to build a new archive. iDigBio will periodically monitor the RSS feed that is associated with the DwC-Archive library within the portal. You should regularly refresh this archive to ensure the data within iDigBio remains current.
