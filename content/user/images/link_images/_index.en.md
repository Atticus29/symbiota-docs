{{< notice info >}}
  This page addresses a common digitization workflow challenge: how do you link images of specimens (with new barcode numbers) to specimen records that already exist in the portal if the barcode number isn't associated with the old data yet? Here we describe two options to solve this problem.

### Option 1: Add catalog (barcode) numbers to occurrence records while imaging

### Option 2: View new images in the portal and link by manually entering the accession number
