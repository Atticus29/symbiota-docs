{{< notice info >}}
  This page addresses a common digitization workflow challenge: how do you link images of specimens (with new barcode numbers) to specimen records that already exist in the portal if the barcode number isn't associated with the old data yet? Here we describe two options to solve this problem.

{{< notice note >}}
  The following instructions assume that the barcode number is stored in the Catalog Number field, and the accession number (usually a stamped number) is stored in the Other Catalog Numbers field.

### Option 1: Add catalog (barcode) numbers to occurrence records while imaging

### Option 2: View new images in the portal and link by manually entering the accession number
1. Log in to your account and navigate to your Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile > Occurrence Management > name of collection).
2. Click Edit Existing Occurrence Records.
3. In the Record Search Form, click the Processing Status field and select “Unprocessed” from the dropdown menu.
4. In the Custom Field 1 field, select Other Catalog Number from the first dropdown menu and IS NULL from the second dropdown menu.
5. Click the “Display Editor” button.
6. Locate the accession number (the stamped number, rather than the barcoded number or the collector number) on the specimen in the image to the right of the Occurrence Editor form.
  * You can zoom in by pressing Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) and clicking on the image where you want to zoom in. Alternatively, you can hold Shift, click on the area where you want to zoom in, and move the mouse up (to zoom in) or down (to zoom out).
