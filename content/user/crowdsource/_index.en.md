Symbiota has a built-in crowdsourcing module that can enable any logged-in user to transcribe specimen data from provided images. These specimens must have a processing status of "unprocessed" and have an associated image.

In this section, you can find [Instructions for Collections](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/crowdsource/collection/ and [Instructions for Crowdsourcers](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/crowdsource/individual/).
