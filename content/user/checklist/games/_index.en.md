{{< notice info >}}
   This page describes how to use the games features of checklists for educational purposes. One suggested use case is to create teaching checklists that can then be used in conjunctions with the Games tool to provide a study aid to students. No user permissions or login is required to play checklist games.

1. Log into your Symbiota profile and navigate to your portal's list of existing checklists. Look for a "Projects" or "Checklists" tab at the top of your portal interface.
2. Select the checklist containing content that you wish to create a game from. When the checklist's page opens, hover over the "Games" icon to select the game you wish to use.

# Name Game

## Summary
"Name Game" is a memory recall game that prompts users to guess (and spell) a genus and species included in a given checklist.

## How to play
- Begin by guessing a letter that you believe might occur in the species name. Every time you incorrectly guess a letter, your remaining number of chances (3-12) will decrease. The :rose::sunflower::apple: icons simply visualize your progress and remaining number of changes (i.e., the rose withers, the apple is consumed, and the flower petals are removed with diminishing chances).
- **Hints**: Selecting a hint will cost you one chance, and they cannot be used on your last guess. On the keypad, the :grey_question: button (wildcard) will fill in one letter for you, and the _Show Family_ button will display the species' family.
- If you correctly guess the species before your chances run out (0), your number of games won will increase. If you do not correctly guess the species, you can select _Reveal the Answer_ to display the genus and species name. In either case, a link will then appear to the taxon record for further study.
- _New Game_ will prompt the next question. Your number of games played, won, and success rate will be tracked as you continue playing and initiate new games.

## Other tips
- Your selected difficulty level affects how many chances you get: 3 (hardest), 6, or 12 (easiest).
- Spaces are already displayed for you. You do not have to guess them.
- You cannot change the difficulty level mid-game

# Flash Card Quiz

## Summary
The "Flash Card Quiz" prompts users to identify species listed in a given checklist by recalling images.

## How to play
- Choose the species displayed in the image from the _Name of Organism_ dropdown list. Up to 5 images of the species will be recalled.
- If you identify the species correctly, a message will alert you to this success, and it will be tallied as one point below the image. If you identify the species correctly on the first try, that success will also be tracked below the image.
- If you cannot identify a specimen, select _Tell Me What It Is!_ and the taxon record will display for further study.
- Selecting _Display Common Names_ will add common names to the species list that displays in the _Name of Above Organism_ dropdown menu.
- _Reset Game_ will reset your score to zero.

## Other tips
- If the images are not displaying, try using a different browser.
- The quiz will bring up the first image associated with the taxon record, up to a maximum of five images. The sort order of these images can be edited on the taxon record to display in a different order. (See [game administration]({{ site.baseurl }}/symbiota-docs/content/user/checklist/games/#game-administration").)

# Game administration
The species and images displayed in each game are dependent on the contents of the selected checklist. If you have permission to edit the checklist, you can to add/remove taxa from the list. Likewise, if your account has Taxon Profile permissions, you can edit the sort order of images [in the Taxon Profile Editor]({{ site.baseurl }}/symbiota-docs/images/games_imagesort.png") such that the images you want to display will be visible in the flash card game (whereby a value of "1" will make an image the first to appear). However, be aware that such changes will affect how the images display across the portal--not just within your game.
