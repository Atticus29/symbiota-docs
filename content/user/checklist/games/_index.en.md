   This page describes how to use the games features of checklists for educational purposes. One suggested use case is to create teaching checklists that can then be used in conjunctions with the Games tool to provide a study aid to students.

1. Log into your Symbiota profile and navigate to your portal's list of existing checklists. Look for a "Projects" or "Checklists" tab at the top of your portal interface.
2. Select the checklist containing content that you wish to create a game from. When the checklist's page opens, hover over the "Games" icon to select the game you wish to use.

# Name game

## Summary
Memory recall game that prompts users to guess (and spell) a genus and species in a given checklist.

## How to play
- Begin by guessing a letter that you believe might occurr in the species name. Every time you incorrectly guess a letter, your remaining number of chances (3-12) will decrease. The :rose::sunflower::apple: icons simply visualize your progress and remaining changes (i.e., the rose withers, the apple is consumed, and the flower petals are removed with diminishing chances).
- **Hints**: Selecting a hint will cost you one chance, and they cannot be used on your last guess. On the keypad, the :grey_question: button (wildcard) will fill in one letter for you, and the _Show Family_ button will display the species' family.
- If you successfully guess the species before yuour chances run out (0), . If you do not correctly guess the species, you can select _Reveal the Answer_ to display the genus and species name. In either case, a link will then appear to the taxon record for further study, if desired.
- _New Game_ will prompt the next question. Your number of games played, won, and success rate will be tracked as you continue playing and initiate new games.

## Other tips
- Your selected **difficulty level** affects how many chances you get: 3 (=most difficult), 6, or 12 (=easiest)
- Spaces are already displayed for you. You do not have to guess them.
- You cannot change settings settings while in the middle of a game
