A checklist is a list of taxa for a certain region or use (e.g., a teaching list so that students can learn a certain set of taxa, or a list of rare or threatened taxa). The checklist tools in Symbiota offer:
  * Viewing a checklist by scientific names, common names, images in the image library, or a combination of these options
  * Linking voucher specimens from the Symbiota portal
  * Management of notes (either public or private) associated with taxa in the checklist
  * Identification and name recognition/spelling games
  * Identification keys consisting of only taxa from the checklist


To create a checklist, you can:
  * Upload a pre-existing list of taxonomic names using the [batch uploader](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/checklist/add/).
  * Find taxa that should be included in your checklist based on voucher specimens that meet user-specified geographic criteria (e.g., a polygon, bounding box, or text field). [Instructions here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/checklist/from-vouch/).
