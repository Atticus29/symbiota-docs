A research checklist is a list of taxa for a certain region or use (e.g., a teaching list so that students can learn a certain set of taxa). All checklists have access to the images in the image library, the flash card quiz tool, and the spelling tool.

Checklists may be documented by voucher specimens, which may be in several different collections. The checklist tool enables linking to voucher specimens, if they are available online, or simply listing their catalog number if not. The voucher tool also enables tracking new potential voucher specimens and re-identification of existing vouchers.
