{{< notice info >}}
This page describes how to the states that are applied to given taxa for identification keys. {{</ notice >}}

{{< notice note >}}
A user must have Identification Keys Editor access to edit character and state values in a portal, since these edits affect the entire portal, not just a single checklist. {{</ notice >}}

### Structure of Identification Keys

Identification keys are built from a list of **characters** that each have multiple **states**.

**Characters** are categories of traits that are shared across all members of a taxon (e.g., "average wing length" or "leaf phyllotaxy").

A **state** is the specific trait that is shared within the taxon (e.g., "3-15 mm" or "opposite", for each of the characters above). At this time, states can only be categorical (i.e., you cannot enter a number value).

Setting up identification keys in a portal requires the administrator to import or add character and state values (see ID Keys Administrator instructions [here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/idkeys/admin/). Then, an identification keys editor can assign certain state values to certain taxa (see ID Keys Editor Instructions [here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/idkeys/edit/).
