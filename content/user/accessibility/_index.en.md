Users who create accounts in the portal can turn on **Accessibility Mode**, which was designed to improve accessibility to the site for people with disabilities. More information about accessibility as defined by [U.S. Section 508 can be found here](https://www.section508.gov/).

In general, Accessibility Mode makes content and forms easier to navigate using a screen reader and expands layouts, which can improve accessibility for users with differing experience, knowledge, language skills, or concentration levels.

#### Turning on Accessibility Mode temporarily
Your portal may have an Accessibility Mode link on the homepage or header. Click this, if so. If not, proceed to the next section.

#### Turn on Accessibility Mode for your user profile
You can make Accessibility Mode the default for whenever you log in to the portal by following these steps:

1. Log in to your portal and navigate to your profile by clicking My Profile.
2. Click the User Profile tab.
3. Click Edit Profile.
4. Check the box next to "Check to indicate a preference for accessibility-optimized styles".
