Glossary terms can be linked to both characters and character states used in [identification keys](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/idkeys/) to help define these characters and character states.

Glossary terms can be linked in the same interface used to edit and add characters and character states. Instructions for doing so [can be found here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/idkeys/admin/).
