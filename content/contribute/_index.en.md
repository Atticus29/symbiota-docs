### How to contribute

{{< notice note >}}We'll be offering hands-on workshops on how to manage content in GitHub! Stay tuned.{{</ notice >}}

{{< faq "Technical details (for users familiar with GitHub)" >}}
  Content on this site is open source and managed through the [GitHub](https://github.com/) development platform. The front-end is compiled with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Each topic is structured in directories that include a markdown file that receives the name of `_index.<language tag>.md`. Anyone with a GitHub account can create a fork of this repository and contribute directly in the folder structure, or look for the "Edit this content on GitHub" button in the bottom of a particular page to edit its content in a new fork. To submit your contribution, please [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). To submit bug reports, please open an issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BioKIC/symbiota-docs/). To see discussions or start a new conversation, please visit our [Discussions tab in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/BioKIC/symbiota-docs/discussions).

3. Learn the basics of the Git flow on GitHub: [forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), pushing and [opening a pull request on GitHub]((https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)).
4. Browse the structured topics inside the `content` folder in the [Symbiota Docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/BioKIC/symbiota-docs).
5. Explore the available formatting options inside the `resources/templates` directory.
