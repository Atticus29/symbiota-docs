Symbiota portals serve data from specimens and observations according to regional and taxonomic themes. To search and view these data, you can use one of the tools described below.

### Basic Search

1. From the home page of the portal, click Search Collections from the top or side menu.
2. If prompted on the next page, select or deselect collections from the provided list depending on which collections you would like to search.
      * If you do not wish to search specific collections, leave all the collections checked.

{{< notice tip >}}
  There may be three tabs at the top of the page, "Specimens & Observations", "Specimens", and "Observations". Specimens are phyiscal collections of an organism, while observations are human observations or photos of organisms that are not supported by physical specimens. Use these tabs to select between these types of occurrences, if desired.
