  This page describes the fields available in Symbiota. The Symbiota data schema is strongly aligned to the Darwin Core data exchange standard. For more details, links to the Darwin Core definitions are supplied for each term.

Since portals have the ability to customize the field names found on their data entry form, field names may differ from the core field definition and how it is mapped to Darwin Core export tools.

### Standard Fields


| Field                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Example(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Darwin Core field                                                                                                                                                            |

| Catalog Number                     | The unique identifier (primary key) for the specimen record. This field   should be used to store the barcode or the accession number (herbaria only).   This field is enforced to be unique per collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | WIS-L-0123456, ASU0012345, 12345                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [catalogNumber](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:catalogNumber)                                                                                                               |
| Other Catalog Numbers              | Any other identifier for a specimen record that is not the catalog   number. This field is typically used to store the old catalog number for   collections that are in the process of switching from one cataloging system   to another (e.g. barcode system).                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 12345                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [otherCatalogNumbers](https://dwc.tdwg.org/term/#dwc:otherCatalogNumbers)                                                                                                    |
| Collector                          | The name of the person who collected the specimen or made the   observation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | C.G.

| Associated Collectors              | Other collectors that were present at the time of collection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | John R.

| Number                             | The collection number assigned to the specimen by the collector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1294, 12490b, 94-132                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [recordNumber](https://dwc.tdwg.org/term/#dwc:recordNumber)                                                                                                                  |
| Date                               | The date the specimen was collected. While dates can be entered using   your preferred format, the value will be converted and stored as an ISO-8601   numeric format (YYYY-MM-DD). Note that unknown month and days can be entered   as “00”. For example, a collection with a date of “March 1956” can be entered   as “1956-03-00”.                                                                                                                                                 | 1983-09-15, 1983-07-00, 1934-00-00                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [eventDate](https://dwc.tdwg.org/term/#dwc:eventDate)                                                                                                                        |
| Verbatim Date                      | Can be used to record date exactly as entered on label. Particularly   useful for non-standard date formats or date ranges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Spring 1901, March-April 1952, late Sept. 1909                                                                                                                                                                                     | [verbatimEventDate](https://dwc.tdwg.org/term/#dwc:verbatimEventDate)                                                                                                        |
| Year, Month, Day                   | The numeric value of the year,   month, and day at the time of collection. These fields are automatically   populated when the date is entered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [year](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#year),   [month](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:month),   [day](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#day)                   |
| Day of year range                  | A range of collection dates can be represented here as numeric day of   year values.
