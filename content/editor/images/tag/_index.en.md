  This page describes how to tag images of occurrences.
{{</ notice >}}

Occurrence images can be tagged with important metadata about what is contained within that image. For example, a specimen can be marked as representing an adult organism or an immature organism. Some possible tags are shown in the image below:

To tag an image, navigate to the occurrence to which that image belongs (see [this page](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/)). Then click the Images tab. Click the edit button ![Edit Button](/symbiota-docs/images/edit.png) and scroll down to the checklist of tags that you can add to the image. Click the Submit Image Edits button when complete.

There is currently no user interface for batch-tagging images; however, you can request to batch tag images through your portal administrator.
