GEOLocate is a software for georeferencing natural history data that was developed in 2005 and has continued to be improved and expanded. A GEOLocate module is available for Symbiota instances and can be accessed from the occurrence editor page or the [Batch Georeferencing Tool](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/georeference/batch/). Below are some resources about the GEOLocate program:
