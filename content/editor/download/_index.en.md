As an editor, your primary mechanism of downloading data is to use the [public search and download tools](/symbiota-docs/user/download/download_data/). For more specialized searches, contact an administrator of your collection so they can use the [Exporter Tool](/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/download/exporter/).

Alternatively, you can download the entire Darwin Core Archive of your data (through the public search or [these instructions](/symbiota-docs/editor/download/dwc/)) and conduct a search in the occurrences.csv file using a spreadsheet editor.
