{{< notice info >}}
Some citation features will require initial configuration by your portal manager or the Symbiota Support Hub prior to full implementation; [refer to the relevant portal manager documentation for more information](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/portal_manager/current_notes/citations/).

 As collections become available online, citing them properly is necessary to enable full digital connectivity between specimens, their [extended data](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/72/10/978/6648186), and the published literature. Symbiota maintains a suite of options to enable proper attribution of collections data shared through our portals.

## Citation options for..
 
### Collections

#### For collections published to GBIF
The Hub strongly encourages publishing your collections data to GBIF because doing so enables robust data use tracking through [GBIF's citation tools](https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines), some of which can be directly integrated into collections profiles. 

If a collection is published to GBIF, a green citation widget will appear in its public profile. 

If your collection publishes its data to GBIF, it is wise to preemtively encourage researchers to properly cite your data according to [GBIF's citation guidelines](https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines).


#### For collections _not published to GBIF
 
### Datasets

## Portal Data Use Policy
 Portal communities may opt to maintain their own portal-wide data use policy. To request modifications to your portal's data use policy, contact your portal manager. This information can be found on the _Sitemap_ > _Image Library_ > _Usage Policy and Copyright Information_. Sample data use policies include:
- [CCH2](https://www.cch2.org/portal/includes/usagepolicy.php)
- [NEON Biorepository](https://biorepo.neonscience.org/portal/includes/usagepolicy.php)
- [SEINet](https://swbiodiversity.org/seinet/includes/usagepolicy.php)

Guidance for Researchers
Now that LACMIPâ€™s collections are becoming available online, citing the relevant numbers is necessary to enable full digital connectivity between these specimens and the published literature.
