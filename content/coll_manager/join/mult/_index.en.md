**What do I do if I have multiple collections? Should I keep them all in one portal?**
If you have multiple collections (e.g., vascular plants, fungi, and bryophytes), it is recommnded to manage these separately in their respective data portals. This is because the taxonomic thesauri of the portals are well-curated to their focal taxonomic group, and you are more likely to be able to take advantage of digitization efficiencies (e.g., duplicate matching) in that portal.

**What if I want to have the same collection in more than one portal?**
In some cases, multiple portals may benefit from including some or all of your collection's data. For example, the Chico State University Herbarium manages their vascular plant data in the Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH2) portal, their bryophyte data in the Bryophyte Portal, and their Lichen data in the Lichen Portal. However, a copy of their bryophyte and lichen data can be found in the CCH2 portal as well. To do this, you can load a **snapshot** of your data (or a subset of your data) into another portal. This can be done easily by creating a "Darwin Core Archive Provider" upload profile that maps a Darwin Core Archive from another Symbiota portal.
