#### Welcome to the Collection Manager Guide!

In this guide, you will find instructions for more advanced functions that are available to users with **Administrator** permissions.

Administrators automatically gain Editor permissions as well, so much of the content in the [Editor Guide](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/) will also be useful for Collection Managers / Administrators.
